# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
In this Python mini project, I have used the libraries librosa, soundfile, and sklearn (among others) to build a model using an MLPClassifier. This will be able to recognize emotion from sound files. The functions of loading  the data, extracting features from it, then spliting the dataset into training and testing sets have been performed. Then an MLP Classifier has been initialized and model is trained . Finally model accuracy has been calculated.
